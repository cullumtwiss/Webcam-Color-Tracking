# Webcam-Color-Tracking
This code has 3 modes of color tracking: hitting the key w just shows what the webcam is seeing, hitting r fills the largest region of the color you click with a color,
hitting p does the same thing as r but leaves a trail of where that largest region has been (making a painting effect). There are also 3 brush modes: hitting x makes the 
fill color blue, hitting y makes the fill color the same as the color that you clicked, and hitting z makes the fill color randomly change over time. 'C' is to clear, 'o' 
is to save the image with the largest region filled, and 's' is to save the painting that results from the trail left in paint mode. You must have the necessary opencv 
files in the project SDKs for this to work (see import statements in Webcam.java). Enjoy!
